# unc-dissertation-template-2022
A LaTeX template for dissertations submitted to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill based on the 2022 guidelines. Please refer to the most recent version of the guidelines, they seem to change a little bit every year! https://gradschool.unc.edu/academics/thesis-diss/guide/

## How to use this template
This template is compatible as of early 2022 with Overleaf. Simply upload the project files into an empty Overleaf project and compile main.tex. To add an additional chapter, create a new .tex file and insert the following:

	\documentclass[crop=false,12pt,class=report]{standalone}
	\doublespacing
	\begin{document}
	
	# Your content goes here
	
	\end{document}

Some very basic examples are provided in the placeholder chapters in the template. Overleaf also provides some really helpful LaTeX documentation at https://www.overleaf.com/learn
